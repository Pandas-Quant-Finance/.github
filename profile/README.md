This is a collection of python tools used for quant finance and machine learning.

Currently, everything is under development and pretty fluid. However, feel free to look around, clone or contribute.

For the moment the repositories are somewhat dependent on each other, until they make it to pypi it is best to clone all of them into the same directory and add the source folders to your python path manually:

Use python version 3.9

```bash
 env PYTHONPATH="`pwd`/pandas_ta_quant/pandas-ta:`pwd`/pandas_ta_quant/pandas-ta-quant:`pwd`/pandas_ta_quant/pandas-ta-ml:`pwd`/../pandas_df_commons/pandas-df-commons"
```
