This is a collection of python tools used for quant finance and machine learning.

Currently everything is under development and pretty fluid. However feel free to look around, clone or contribute.

For the moment the repositiroes are somewhat dependent on each other, until they make it to pypi it is best to clone all of them into the same directory and add the source folders to your python path manually:

```bash
 env PYTHONPATH="`pwd`/pandas_ta_quant/pandas-ta:`pwd`/pandas_ta_quant/pandas-ta-quant:`pwd`/pandas_ta_quant/pandas-ta-ml:`pwd`/../pandas_df_commons/pandas-df-commons"
```
